# 🎨 Theme Manager for Flipper Zero



Manage dolphin animation themes directly from your Flipper Zero — no PC required.

## Download

- Flipper Apps Catalog (coming soon)
- GitHub Releases: https://github.com/Hoasker/flipper-theme-manager/releases

## Screenshots

Please see the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Hoasker/flipper-theme-manager) for screenshots and a full workflow GIF.

## Features

- Scan SD card — auto-detects animation packs in /ext/animation_packs/
- **3 theme formats** — Pack (P), Anim Pack (A), Single animation (S)
- **Animation preview** — thumbnail of first frame on the info screen
- **Theme info** — view type, animation count, and size before applying
- **One-tap apply** — merges theme files into /ext/dolphin/
- **Delete themes** — remove theme packs directly from the app
- **Auto-backup** — backs up entire /ext/dolphin/ before overwriting
- **Restore** — revert to previous theme from the menu
- **Reboot dialog** — apply and reboot instantly, or keep browsing

## Installation

**From Releases (recommended)**

1. Download theme_manager.fap from Releases: https://github.com/Hoasker/flipper-theme-manager/releases
2. Copy to your Flipper's SD card: /ext/apps/Tools/

**Build from source**

cd theme_manager
ufbt

Copy dist/theme_manager.fap to SD card, or use ufbt launch to build & run.

## Adding Themes

Place theme folders in /ext/animation_packs/ on your SD card:

**Format A — Pack (manifest + animation folders)**
  animation_packs/MyTheme/
  ├── manifest.txt
  ├── Anim1/
  │   ├── meta.txt
  │   └── frame_*.bm
  └── Anim2/
      ├── meta.txt
      └── frame_*.bm

**Format B — Anim Pack (Anims/ subdirectory)**
  animation_packs/MyTheme/
  └── Anims/
      ├── manifest.txt
      ├── Anim1/
      └── Anim2/

**Format C — Single Animation**
  animation_packs/MySingleAnim/
  ├── meta.txt
  ├── frame_0.bm
  ├── frame_1.bm
  └── ...

## How It Works

1. Scans /ext/animation_packs/ for supported theme formats
2. Select a theme → view info with animation preview
3. Apply → backs up /ext/dolphin/ → merges new theme
4. Reboot to see new animations, or keep browsing
5. Use **Restore Previous** to revert anytime

## Custom Firmware

Override default paths at compile time:

ufbt CFLAGS='-DCUSTOM_ANIMATION_PACKS_PATH=EXT_PATH("my_anims")'
ufbt CFLAGS='-DCUSTOM_DOLPHIN_PATH=EXT_PATH("my_dolphin")'

## Requirements

- Flipper Zero with microSD card
- Works with official & custom firmware (Momentum, Unleashed, RogueMaster)
